The problem before was:

double d1 = 174.56;
double d2 = 174.26;

sout(d1-d2):

Output: 0.300000000000000001137 -> This is not precise. We don't want this especially in banking

If you use double or float, don't use double, instead use BigDecimal -> Look at BigDecimalDemo

Scale and Rounding will not be used in the class a lot, but you can find an example.
You cannot scale something without rounding.
CEILING and FLOORING are rounding methods
