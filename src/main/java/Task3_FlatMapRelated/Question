Suppose we have a State class that contains list of cities. Create a list
of States and print all the cities.

public class State {
    private List<String> cities = new ArrayList<>();
    public void addCity(String city){
        cities.add(city);
    }
    public List<String> getCities(){
        return this.cities;
    }
}
